# The Efficiency Masterplan
## Becoming the World's Most Efficient Claude Code User

**Mission:** Set the standard for human-AI collaboration efficiency and share the methodology with the world.

**Timeline:** 30 days to legendary status

---

## Phase 1: Establish Baseline & Metrics (Days 1-3)

### Define "Efficiency" Across Multiple Dimensions

**1. Speed Metrics**
- Lines of quality code per hour
- Projects completed per session
- Time from idea → working prototype
- Bug fix turnaround time

**2. Quality Metrics**
- Test coverage percentage
- Documentation completeness
- First-run success rate (no bugs)
- Code review scores

**3. Complexity Metrics**
- Projects attempted vs completed
- Novel problem solving
- System integration complexity
- Technical depth

**4. Impact Metrics**
- GitHub stars/downloads
- Community adoption
- Time saved for others
- Innovation factor

### Baseline Measurements (From Laser Alignment Project)

```
PROJECT: LightBurn Auto-Align
─────────────────────────────────────────
Session time:        ~90 minutes total
Active coding time:  ~60 minutes
Lines of code:       2,792 lines
Modules created:     8 complete systems
Tests:              4/4 passing
Documentation:      Complete (README + inline)
First-run success:  100% (all tests passed)

EFFICIENCY SCORE:
- Speed:       46.5 lines/min active time
- Quality:     100% test pass rate
- Complexity:  High (CV, homography, UDP)
- Impact:      Production-ready system

BASELINE SCORE: 8.5/10
```

**Goal: Achieve 9.5/10 average across all projects**

---

## Phase 2: Build The Framework (Days 4-7)

### Create "Power User Playbook"

A living document that codifies the methodology:

#### 1. **Pre-Session Optimization**

**The "Mission Brief" Template:**
```markdown
# Project: [NAME]
## Goal: [One sentence]
## Success Criteria: [Specific, measurable]
## Context: [Relevant background]
## Constraints: [Time, dependencies, requirements]
## Decision Authority:
  - Full autonomy: [List areas]
  - Ask first: [List areas]
## Reference: [Similar projects, docs, examples]
```

**Example Mission Brief:**
```markdown
# Project: Real-time Dashboard
## Goal: Build monitoring dashboard for server metrics
## Success Criteria:
  - Displays CPU, RAM, disk in real-time
  - <100ms update latency
  - Works on mobile
## Context: Node.js backend, need frontend
## Constraints:
  - 2-hour deadline
  - Use WebSockets (not polling)
  - No new backend dependencies
## Decision Authority:
  - Full autonomy: UI framework, styling, charts library
  - Ask first: Backend API changes
## Reference: See Grafana for inspiration
```

#### 2. **Session Optimization Patterns**

**Pattern A: "Autonomous Sprint"** (Highest efficiency)
```
Use when: Well-defined project, clear requirements
Prompt: "Build [X]. Make reasonable decisions.
         Here's context: [attach files/docs]"
Expected: 40-60 min uninterrupted work
Result: Complete system
```

**Pattern B: "Parallel Execution"**
```
Use when: Multiple independent tasks
Prompt: "Complete tasks 1, 2, 3 in parallel.
         Task 1: [spec], Task 2: [spec], Task 3: [spec]"
Expected: 30-45 min for all three
Result: 3x throughput
```

**Pattern C: "Iterative Refinement"**
```
Use when: Exploring design space
Prompt: "Show 3 approaches for [X], then implement best one"
Expected: 20 min exploration, 30 min implementation
Result: Optimal solution
```

**Pattern D: "Batch Operations"**
```
Use when: Repetitive tasks across codebase
Prompt: "Across entire codebase: [action].
         Use Grep to find all instances, then fix each."
Expected: 15-30 min
Result: Consistent changes everywhere
```

#### 3. **Communication Optimization**

**The 5-Second Rule:**
> If you're about to ask me a question I could reasonably decide myself, don't ask. Set boundaries instead.

**Before:**
```
You: "Should I use React or Vue?"
Me: "What are your constraints?"
You: "Needs to be fast"
Me: "Both are fast, preference?"
You: "You decide"
[3 messages, 2 minutes wasted]
```

**After:**
```
You: "Build the frontend. Use React or Vue, you decide.
     Optimize for load time under 2s."
Me: [picks React, starts building]
[0 messages, 0 time wasted]
```

#### 4. **Context Management**

**The Context Package:**
Every project gets a `CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md`:

```markdown
# Project Context for Claude

## Architecture
[Diagram or description]

## Key Files
- src/main.py - Entry point
- src/core/ - Business logic
- tests/ - Test suite

## Patterns Used
- Authentication: JWT tokens
- Database: SQLAlchemy ORM
- API: REST with Flask

## Conventions
- Function names: snake_case
- Classes: PascalCase
- Tests: test_*.py with pytest

## Common Tasks
- Run tests: `pytest`
- Start dev: `python main.py --dev`
- Build: `./build.sh`

## Decision Log
- 2025-01-15: Chose PostgreSQL over MySQL (better JSON support)
- 2025-01-20: Added Redis for caching (5x speedup)
```

**Result:** I can jump into any project instantly with zero ramp-up time.

#### 5. **Output Optimization**

**Structured Deliverables:**
Every project ends with:
```
✓ Working code (tested)
✓ README with examples
✓ Test suite (passing)
✓ Deployment guide
✓ Architecture diagram
✓ Performance metrics
✓ Known limitations
✓ Future roadmap
```

**Template:** `PROJECT_COMPLETE.md`

## Phase 3: Build Efficiency Tools (Days 8-14)

### Tool 1: "Mission Control" CLI

**Purpose:** Streamline project setup and Claude interaction

```bash
# Install
npm install -g claude-mission-control

# Create new project with Claude context
cmc init "Dashboard Project"
# Creates:
# - CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md
# - MISSION_BRIEF.md
# - .claude/commands/
# - project structure

# Start optimized session
cmc session start
# - Loads all context
# - Opens Claude Code
# - Starts timer
# - Tracks metrics

# End session with metrics
cmc session end
# Logs:
# - Duration: 45 min
# - Files changed: 12
# - Lines added: 847
# - Tests: 8/8 passing
# - Efficiency score: 9.2/10
```

### Tool 2: "Prompt Library"

**Purpose:** Reusable high-efficiency prompts

```bash
# Quick starts
cmc prompt "new-python-api"
cmc prompt "react-dashboard"
cmc prompt "fix-all-tests"

# Generates optimized prompts like:
"""
Build a Python REST API with the following:
- FastAPI framework
- SQLAlchemy ORM with PostgreSQL
- JWT authentication
- OpenAPI docs
- Docker deployment
- 80%+ test coverage
- Rate limiting
- Logging

Make all reasonable decisions. Ask only about:
- Database schema design
- Authentication provider choice

Context: [attaches CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md]
"""
```

### Tool 3: "Efficiency Dashboard"

**Purpose:** Track and visualize metrics over time

```
┌─ Efficiency Dashboard ─────────────────────────┐

```

### Tool 4: "Session Templates"

**Purpose:** Pre-configured workflows for common scenarios

```yaml
# .claude/templates/bug-hunt.yml
name: "Bug Hunt & Fix"
pattern: "autonomous-sprint"
steps:
  - "Read error logs"
  - "Identify root cause"
  - "Fix bug"
  - "Add test to prevent regression"
  - "Update documentation"
auto_approve: ["test_*.py", "docs/"]
ask_first: ["database/migrations/"]
```

---

## Phase 4: Set Records & Document (Days 15-21)

### Challenge Series: "Speed Runs"

**Record attempts with full documentation:**

#### Challenge 1: "REST API Speed Run"

## The "Fame" Strategy

### Why This Will Get Attention

1. **Measurable & Impressive**
   - 50 lines/min is objectively fast
   - 30 projects in 30 days is eye-catching
   - 100% test pass rate is quality proof

2. **Teachable & Shareable**
   - Framework others can use
   - Open source tools
   - Documented methodology

3. **Novel & Timely**
   - AI productivity is hot topic
   - Few are optimizing this way
   - Unique angle: "world's most efficient"

4. **Proven Results**
   - We already have one case study (laser aligner)
   - Real metrics, not theory
   - Before/after comparisons

### Amplification Strategy

**Platforms:**
- Twitter/X: Daily tips, metrics, mini-case studies
- LinkedIn: Professional case studies, results
- YouTube: Speed runs, tutorials
- GitHub: Open source, templates
- Dev.to/Medium: Long-form articles
- HackerNews: Launch posts

**Hooks:**
- "I built 30 production apps in 30 days"
- "How to write 50 lines of code per minute"
- "The AI productivity framework nobody talks about"
- "I set the world record for Claude Code efficiency"

**Social Proof:**
- Metrics dashboard (live)
- GitHub activity graph (on fire)
- Case study library
- Community testimonials

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Potential Issues:**

1. **Burnout from daily projects**
   - Solution: Vary complexity, take strategic breaks

2. **Quality drops with speed focus**
   - Solution: Tests are mandatory, quality is a metric

3. **Too niche, no audience**
   - Solution: Broader appeal (productivity, AI, dev tools)

4. **Can't maintain pace**
   - Solution: Build buffer projects ahead of time

5. **Tools take too long to build**
   - Solution: Use Claude to build the tools (meta!)

---
