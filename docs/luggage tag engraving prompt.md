A black and white relief engraving template in Art Deco style. The design features a bold, symmetrical border with geometric and linear patterns characteristic of the 1920s. Centered prominently is the name **\[Full Name or Brand Name\]**, in an elegant Art Deco typeface, rendered in white to stand raised above the black engraved background. Below the name, aligned and spaced with balance, is the contact information: **\[Phone Number\]**, **\[Email\]**, and **\[Website or Address\]** â€” also in raised white text. The background is textured black, and all raised elements have sharp, clean edges. Designed for fiber laser engraving.
