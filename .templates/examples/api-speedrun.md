# Mission Brief: REST API Speed Run

**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes
**Complexity:** Medium
**Target Efficiency Score:** 9.5/10

---

## üéØ Goal
Build a complete REST API with CRUD operations, authentication, and database integration in under 30 minutes.

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria
- [ ] 5 RESTful endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, LIST)
- [ ] JWT authentication working
- [ ] Database integration (PostgreSQL or SQLite)
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage
- [ ] OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] README with usage examples
- [ ] Deployable with Docker

---

## üìã Context

### Problem
Need a production-ready API for [RESOURCE] management with proper authentication and documentation.

### Desired State
A fully functional API that can be deployed immediately and handle real traffic.

### Technical Approach
- FastAPI for high performance and auto-docs
- SQLAlchemy ORM for database flexibility
- JWT tokens for stateless auth
- Pytest for testing

---

## üöß Requirements

### Must Have
- Create [RESOURCE] (POST)
- Read single [RESOURCE] (GET /{id})
- Read all [RESOURCES] with pagination (GET /)
- Update [RESOURCE] (PUT /{id})
- Delete [RESOURCE] (DELETE /{id})
- Authentication middleware
- Input validation
- Error handling
- API documentation

### Should Have
- Rate limiting
- Logging
- CORS configuration

### Won't Have (This Version)
- Admin panel
- Email notifications
- File uploads

---

## üé® Technical Constraints

### Technology Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.9+
- **Framework:** FastAPI
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (or SQLite for dev)
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy
- **Testing:** pytest
- **Docs:** Auto-generated by FastAPI

### Constraints
- **Time:** 30 minutes hard deadline
- **Dependencies:** Minimize external packages
- **Performance:** Sub-100ms response time
- **Compatibility:** Python 3.9+

## ü§ù Decision Authority

### Claude Has Full Autonomy On:
- [ ] Database schema design
- [ ] Project structure/file organization
- [ ] Validation rules
- [ ] Error messages and HTTP status codes
- [ ] Test organization
- [ ] Logging format
- [ ] Naming conventions

### Ask Before Deciding:
- [ ] Adding paid/cloud services
- [ ] Changing to different framework
- [ ] Major security decisions
